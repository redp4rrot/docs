# **Fundamentals**

## **Control the OS**

!!! quote "Own it"

    With control, comes power

The most crucial power that is needed to become a system administrator is having the ability to control it as if you really own everything. 

## **Prompt description**
The prompt can be customized using special characters and variables in the shellâ€™s configuration file (.bashrc for the Bash shell).
You can use tools such as [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline){:target="_blank"}, [bash prompt generator](https://bash-prompt-generator.org/){:target="_blank"} etc. to customize the prompt.

## **Getting started**
#### <span class="red-command">General</span>
1. The shell command is too complex!

    Even after learning the basics, if a command appears quite complex, we can break it down into understandable peices using - [explainshell](https://explainshell.com/){:target="_blank"}

2. `~` is the home directory of the currently logged in user.

#### <span class="red-command">System Information</span>

<span class="command">cp</span> (file copying)

This will copy all the files having an extension of `py` from the current working directory to /var/www/html
```

Let's copy a file from Windows 11 to WSL.  
File name is `red (2).ovpn` and location is `/mnt/c/Users/jayan/Downloads/red (2).ovpn`.
```
sudo cp /mnt/c/Users/jayan/Downloads/red (2).ovpn /opt
```

!!! failure "Command interfering with bash"

    -bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('

We need to escape the space and parentheses with <span class="command">\</span>
```
sudo cp /mnt/c/Users/jayan/Downloads/red\ \(2\).ovpn /opt
```

#### <span class="red-command">Text editors</span>
<span class="command">vim</span>

<span class="command">nano</span>

#### <span class="red-command">Locating Files and directories</span>
<span class="command">which</span>

``` bash
r3d@parrot$ which curl
/usr/bin/curl
```

<span class="command">locate</span>
```
locate mssqlclient.py
```

<span class="command">find</span>
```bash
find / -type f -name mssqlclient.py 2>/dev/null
```

#### <span class="red-command">File descriptors & Redirections</span>
What is <span class="red-command">/dev/null</span>?  
Since everything in the OS is a file. Therefore /dev/null is also a file but with some powers vested in it. `/dev/null` is a special device file on Unix-like operating systems that serves as a virtual black hole for data. Any data written to `/dev/null` is discarded, and any read from it returns an end-of-file (EOF) immediately.

What are <span class="red-command">file descriptors (FD)</span>?  
File descriptors are integer values that the operating system assigns to open files or I/O resources.  

| FD             | Meaning                          |
| -----------      | ------------------------------------ |
| 0     | <span class="red-command">STDIN</span>  |
| 1    | <span class="red-command">STDOUT</span> |
| 2     | <span class="red-command">STDERR</span> |

<span class="red-command">
<span class="red-command">

``` bash
touch /tmp/err
 cd ~/../../root
-bash: cd: /home/winusr/../../root: Permission denied
```

If the user is not able to navigate to the root directory, then the output is an `STDERR`.  
Redirection means storing this error somewhere but in real life we don't want to store the error. (Error is different from log)
Therefore, we want to send this `STDERR` to the linux trash can - `/dev/null`

The below command won't output any error as we're redirecting the error to a file - `/tmp/err`
```
cd ~/../../root 2>/tmp/err
```

```
cat /tmp/err
-bash: cd: /home/winusr/../../root: Permission denied
```

Redirecting the error to the trash can(/dev/null)
```
cd ~/../../root 2>/dev/null
```

#### <span class="red-command">Setup python virtual environment</span>
A simple demonstration for creating and activating a python virtual environment.
``` bash
python3 -m venv virtualenv
source virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, we can install all the dependencies within that environment using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

List all the packages installed in the virtual environment
```
pip freeze
```

If there is a `setup.py` file in the repository (for eg. [`Impacket`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket){target=_blank}), then we have to make the modules accessible within the virtual environment.  
Use setup.py to install the module into your Python environment. This will ensure that all dependencies and the package itself are correctly set up.

```
python setup.py install
```

## **Bread and butter**
### <span class="red-command">grep</span>
<span class="command">grep</span> - Global regular expression print.  
<span class="command">-v</span> -  The grep -v flag is used to invert the match in grep. This means that grep -v will output all lines that do not match the specified pattern.

```curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | awk '{gsub(/\\n/, "\n"); print $0;}' | sort -u```


### <span class="red-command">sed</span>
```bash
cat /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf | grep -v '#' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
```

### <span class="red-command">awk</span>
<span class="command">gsub</span> - Global substitute function.

This part of the awk script uses the `gsub` function to globally substitute `\\n` with a real newline character (`\n`). The double backslash is used to escape the `\n` so that awk interprets it as a literal `\n` rather than a newline character.
``` bash
awk '{gsub(/\\n/, "\n"); print $0};' | input.txt
```

### <span class="red-command">cut</span>


### <span class="red-command">sort</span>
<span class="command">-u</span> - This flag stands for "unique" and tells sort to remove duplicate lines from the output.


### <span class="red-command">curl</span>
<span class="command">-I</span> - Only get the HTTP Response headers.
